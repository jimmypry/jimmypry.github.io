# MapReduce 

#### 1. Count the word frequency of a web page

Algorithm
- HashMap

- Multiple machines: merge is a bottle neck. Since optimization is supposed to optimize the bottleneck. 

- Map Reduce: So, we can merge small part and then simply put them together. Map first. The distribute pairs with same keys to the same reduce worker to merge. But when output, there are dirs to put together: 00-02 and 01-02.  

- input -> split -> map -> transfer -> reduce -> output

- Map phase does not do aggregation(merge) but only implements map function.

- Master is used to manege transfer and distribute use consistent hashing.

- reduce is to aggregate the key and output key-freq pair. key's number is the upper limit for reducer number. ([reducebykey vs groupbykey](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43364432/spark-difference-between-reducebykey-vs-groupbykey-vs-aggregatebykey-vs-combineb))

- before transfer will do partition and sort(aggregated as small group). Then the chunk is fetched by the targeting reducer. then merge k sorted list(external sort).

- stop words are used to skip those "meaningless" words.

- shuffle: partition sort + fetch and merge sort

#### 2. Build inverted index using mapreduce
